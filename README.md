  <em>A list of useful resources for learning about Product Design & Management.</em>
</p>

This resource is based on our exepriences running product teams at startups, medium sized & larger co's. We started keeping this list when people kept asking us to point them in the direction of where they can learn how to be a great product manager. The idea was to compile a reference doc of useful links & thoughts that can get people starting.

If you know anyone who is trying to learn how to become a ‘product’ designer/manager, or looking to learn more about that role, there will likely be something interesting and useful for them in this set of resources. Send it along and spread the knowledge!

**Disclaimer**: 
* The list is heavily focused on people building internet based digital products. It also leans heavily towards taking a more heavily towards building startups because that's where we've spent the majority of our time.
* This list will certainly be opinionanted, as it happens to be a collection of the resources we found valuables as we developed our skills. Others may find a different set of lessons & resources to be crucial to developing your sense of building great products.

## Introduction
Being a product person requires a versatile set of skills. A friend once told me there are 3 facets to Product at a digital company: Code, Design, and Business/People skills. They said a talented product person should have an understanding of all 3, but be particularly strong in one of them - preferably Business/People skills. I think that this is a good framework for thinking about what product consists of, and it’s how I think about product when I’ve hired people in those roles in the past.

A product person is almost like a mini-ceo/entrepreneur within a company that is running one particular aspect of the larger product. Because they are like entrepreneurs within companies, many of the lessons that are useful for entrepreneurs are also useful for product people at companies of varying sizes. As a mini-ceo, at a minimum, a product person needs to to know how businesses generally work, have a customer-focused mentality, and be able to coordinate teams of people working towards a clearly articulated vision. They are the glue that brings the pieces to be together. They need to be an excellent communicator. The teams they end up managing usually consist of designers and engineers. In order to work with these teams, to be respected by these teams, and to build quality digital products, a product person needs to have a sufficient understanding of all the disciplines involved. They need to speak the languages of the people they work with - design, code, (and marketing).

You don’t need to know how to code, but you need to know what code is about and how to communicate with engineers. You don’t need to be the best designer in the world, but you should be able to roughly communicate your ideas through rough sketches on paper, understand the different stages of the design process, how to give feedback on designs, and cultivate a sense of which designs work, which don’t, and why that may be the case. You need to know just enough in each of these domains to be conversant, and able to see how everything fits together.

So where should you start in terms of navigating the waters of understanding these 3 domains: Code, Design & Business/People?

There are resources out there that can help you get your bearings in Code, in Design, and in Business/People management, but they’re scattered and there’s no map. We hope this can be a map that points people to resources that help you understand what you need to know to be a good product person. We want to give you starting points in each discipline, and also guidance on how to go as deep as you like in each domain.

This list has useful resources we’ve come across, but we’d like to invite you to contribute interesting resources you’ve found as well. What has helped you get a better grasp of product? What are good books that give people a high level understanding of design and code? What do you think is important to learn about in each domain and what are good resources that explain them (blog posts, online courses, videos?). This is just a grab-bag we thought was useful, and if the community adds some resources as well we can work together to stitch a compelling outline of what a product school curriculum might look like.

## What Is Product Management

### Great Explanations of Product Management Others Have Written:

📖 [Joel Spolsky - How to Be A Program Manager](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/03/09.html)

Joel Spolsky wrote this article in 2009, when making clickable prototypes was still a bit of a pain. At that time, the main output of Product Managers was written specs that described how the product should work. I think that as the cost of making interactive prototypes goes down, Product Managers will lean more heavily on interactive prototyping tools to build clickable, interactive models that clearly explain how the software should work - the prototype is the spec. Once a Product Manager has some knowledge of how API & data modelling work, they can also roughly spec the conceptual framework for how the code should work without needing to actually code.

### Tools & Resources

We taught the Product workshop at Columbia University's Brown Institute and we got confirmation for one of the things that I deeply believe which is that it's much easier to teach people design tools than it is to teach them to code.

## Code 

### How to Approach Learning About Coding

Here what is really needed for product people is not something that teaches you in depth how to code, but instead a resource that gives you an overview understanding of how software and the tools we build with work (e.g. the Internet, APIs, etc.). There's a book called Design for Hackers which does a good job of teaching high-level design  to non-designers, but I'm not aware of an equivalent book that effectively communicates the concepts behind how software works to non-technical people.

Things that are good to understand about the code side of things, along with some decent explanations for each:
* A conceptual understanding of what goes into building a digital product from the code side. You don't need to know how to code, but you should have a rough understanding of what the pieces are that go into building an Internet application.
* What is an API? What is REST? What do people mean when they say 'The Cloud'?
* What is a Database?
* What is a Web Server?
* Relationship between Client (your browser) & Server (the thing that gives you the web page)
* What are some programming languages and in which situations are they suited for the task? What do people mean when they say front-end vs. backend?
* What is a code Framework (e.g. Rails, Express, React, Django)?
* How the Internet works at a high level (e.g. what is HTTP, how do domain names work?)
* What is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web?

* What is Object Oriented Programming - Conceptual Modelling:
📖 [How to Explain Object Oriented Programming to a Non-Technical Person](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/34584/how-to-explain-oop-concepts-to-a-non-technical-person)

* What are APIs? What is REST? What is GraphQL? http://www.quora.com/In-laymans-terms-what-is-an-API-1

* Relationship between Database, APIs & Objects
* oAuth & Authenticating with APIs
* The concept of abstraction:
📖 [Explaining Abstraction to a Non-Programmer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2918308/explaining-abstraction-to-a-non-programmer)

📖 [Paul Ford's 2015 Piece: What is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code)

### Tools
[Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
[Hopscotch](http://gethopscotch.com) If you want to get a really rough sense of code, download HopScotch & play around with it - it's targeted at kids but it gives an excellent exposure to some of the core concepts:

### Books

📚 [The Practice of Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X/ref=pd_sim_b_8?ie=UTF8&refRID=0WHT9BBQ98RBTJY31P20)
